# Snake-Water-and-Gun-Game
This is a simple and fun command-line game based on the classic Snake–Water–Gun rules.
The player chooses Snake (s), Water (w), or Gun (g), and the computer randomly picks one as well.

# The rules are:

Snake (1) drinks Water (-1) → Snake wins

Water (-1) douses Gun (0) → Water wins

Gun (0) kills Snake (1) → Gun wins

If both choices are the same, the game results in a draw.

# How to Play

Run the script.

When prompted, enter:

s → Snake

w → Water

g → Gun

The computer makes a random choice.

The program announces the winner.

# Running the Game
