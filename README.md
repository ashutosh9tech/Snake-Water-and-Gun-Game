# Snake-Water-and-Gun-Game
This repository refers to the fun game programmed through Python. 
This file consist of two players, one the computer and another user. 1 means snake, -1 means water and zero for gun. I have imported random module where it allows, the computer to randomly choose any choice between three. The value inputted by the user i.e., **youstr** must be in the dictionary **youDict**. Another dictionary **reverseDict** is created to inform the value chosen by the computer and user. I have implemented nested if else elif statement to validate the outcome drawn after choosing the values by the respective players.
